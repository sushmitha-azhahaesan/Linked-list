Uses of linked List:

LL is used in the implementation of stacks and queues
Image Gallery, we can toggle between images → Doubly Linked list
Music played  → Doubly Linked list
Browser (by clicking left and right → to go to prev and next page)  → Doubly Linked list
Hash map  and hash set – collision can be handled by chaining → Double linked list


Arrays Vs linkedList:

Arrays:
It allocates memory in a contigious manner. If a[7] spaces is required for integer then 7*4===28 bytes will be allocated for as a whole.
sorting: The elements in array can be ramdomly accessed. a[5] can be accessed as one step at a time.
Due to this, it has huge efficiency with sorting algorithms.
deletion: If one node is deleted all the nodes after that has to be shifted ,Time Complexity: O(n)

Linked List:
where as in LL ,memory is allocated as chunk . If one node enters (only 8 bytes) ,then the memory for that node is alone allocated as chunk.
we can use the chunk memory available.
U have to traverse all the nodes at worst caase to reach a particular node.
Deletion : In O(1) deletion operation can be done if we r at the nodes location. Just reassigning of address.
